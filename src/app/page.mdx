## What is an Anti Pattern?

An anti-pattern is a common approach to solving a problem that appears to be a good solution at first but actually turns out to be ineffective, counterproductive, or harmful in practice.

Key characteristics of anti-patterns:

- They seem like reasonable solutions initially
- They're frequently used despite being problematic
- They create more problems than they solve
- They often emerge from good intentions or incomplete understanding
