# Anti Pattern


An anti-pattern is a common approach to solving a problem that appears to be a good solution at first but actually turns out to be ineffective, counterproductive, or harmful in practice. The term comes from software engineering but has expanded to other fields.

Key characteristics of anti-patterns:
- They seem like reasonable solutions initially
- They're frequently used despite being problematic
- They create more problems than they solve
- They often emerge from good intentions or incomplete understanding
